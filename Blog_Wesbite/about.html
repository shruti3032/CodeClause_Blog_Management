            <h2>My name is Shruti.</h2>
            
            <p> A passionate and driven student at VIIT with a profound interest in web development and technology. Currently, I'm actively involved in crafting web development projects and participating in the Google Arcade program, which has been an incredibly enriching experience.</p>
            
            <p>My journey in the world of web technologies has been nothing short of exciting. I find immense joy in exploring the latest trends and advancements in this ever-evolving field. With each project I undertake, I strive to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web. The dynamic nature of web development keeps me on my toes, and I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skill set.</p>

            <p>Why do I love web development? It's not just about building websites; it's about creating experiences that captivate users and make a positive impact on their lives. There's something magical about turning lines of code into interactive and visually stunning websites.</p>
            
            <p>Besides my web development endeavors, my sights are set on achieving my dream of working with Google. I'm continually honing my skills and staying open to learning new programming languages and technologies that will help me get closer to my goal. The challenge of solving real-world problems with innovative solutions fuels my motivation.</p>

            <p>I started this website as a Project which will motivate to do greate projects along with learning from others experiences as it will listed on my blogging website. </p>
